# What is Github Pages?

## Background
The reason I wrote this page is that what I read from [GitHub Pages introduction](https://pages.github.com/) and what I finally understood it to be are a little different. Here is what I understand. I hope this page helps those who are already familiar with GitHub, so they don't suffer like I did.

## Repository Comes First
Each GitHub repository can have its own GitHub Pages, which is a static site hosting service provided by GitHub. In the repository, we can find source code, while on the GitHub Pages, we can see the actual running website. After you create a repository, you can create its GitHub Pages. Therefore, the repository comes first, and GitHub Pages follow suit.

<Callout type="info">
  It's worth noting that GitHub Pages is a free service when the repository is
  public.
</Callout>

## URL

GitHub Pages hosts a website, so its URL is relevant and follows the repository name and user name.

- The GitHub repository URL is `https://github.com/user-name/` `repository-name`
- The GitHub Pages URL is `https://user-name.github.io/` `repository-name`

For instance, I, `techxxy` have a repository called `docs`, so the URLs of the repository and GitHub Pages become respetively:

- Repository: https://github.com/techxxy/docs
- GitHub Pages: https://techxxy.github.io/docs

## Special Repository

<Callout>
  There is a special repository with a unique feature: its name is
  `user-name.github.io`. In my case, the repository name is `techxxy.github.io`
</Callout>

In normal cases, its GitHub Pages URL should be https://techxxy.github.io/techxxy.github.io. However, it is simply https://techxxy.github.io. Both URLs are functional, with the longer one being redirected to the shorter URL. This Redirection is the only difference: otherwise, everything else is exactly the same as other respositories' GitHub Pages.

## Static Site

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service, meaning only static websites function properly. Alternatively, the README.md file will be displayed.

## New Repository

Please check the image below to see how to create a repository with README.md, especially how to set the name of the special repository.

## Activate GitHub Pages

Once you create a repository, you can activate its GitHub Pages in the repository URL and display the GitHub Pages link in the about section.

<Tabs items={["Activate GitHub Pages", "Display Link"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The image below illustrates how to set up GitHub Pages in the simplest case,
    particularly when it involves a basic website.

    The image below illustrates how to display the GitHub Pages link in the
    about section of a repository page. ![](/show-pages-url.png)
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
