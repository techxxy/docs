# Using Icons

Here are two key things to remember when integrating icons into various types of projects:

1. **[SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols)** for Mac & iOS Projects
2. **[React-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons)** for All Projects

## iOS/Mac Projects

Utilize the Mac application [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols) for seamless integration of icons into your iOS projects. Simply install SF Symbols on your Mac, search for the desired icon, and copy it into Xcode for immediate use.

## React/Next.js Projects
For React (Next.js) projects, consider leveraging libraries such as [React-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons). This comprehensive library includes various open-source icon sets like [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/icons/), [Bootstrap](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) and [Google Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/). Installation instructions are provided at the bottom of the React-icons page and are straightforward to follow. Keep in mind that multiple import statements may be necessary as icons from different packages might be sourced like the following.

``` ts
import { IoWarningOutline } from "react-icons/io5";
import { PiNumberCircleOneFill } from "react-icons/pi";
import { HiOutlineRectangleStack } from "react-icons/hi2";
<PiNumberCircleOneFill />
<HiOutlineRectangleStack />
<IoWarningOutline size="24" />
```

## Other Types of Projects

Explore individual icon downloads available on websites listed within [React-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons). Websites such as [Bootstrap](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) offer SVG downloads for individual icons, while [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/icons/) provides various formats including SVG. These icons can then be directly included in projects, such as a simple HTML site, and even in Mac projects as image assets.

<Steps>
    ### Install

    Install [React-Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) by execution the following command in Terminal:

    ```bash
    npm install react-icons --save
    ```

    ### Select an icon
    Select an icon to use in the [searchbox](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) and click the icon to view the import statement and icon name tag.

    ### Import in .mdx
    Import an icon pack as stated in the code of the selected icon.

    ```mdx
    import { IoWarningOutline } from "react-icons/io5";
    import { PiNumberCircleOneFill } from "react-icons/pi";
    import { HiOutlineRectangleStack } from "react-icons/hi2";
    ```

    If you want to adjust the size of the icons, add the `size` property in icon tags.

    ```mdx
    <PiNumberCircleOneFill />
    <HiOutlineRectangleStack />
    <IoWarningOutline size="24" />
    ```
