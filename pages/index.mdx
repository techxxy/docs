# What is this site for?

Techxxy's Documentation site is designed for myself and experienced software developers or designers who still need detailed, step-by-step information when exploring new fields, languages, or frameworks. Currently, this documentation focuses on NEXT.js, React, Node.js, TypeScript, and more, as I aim to build a full-stack dynamic website based on Next.js.

For a more personal touch while still focusing on software development, please visit [my blog](https://techxxy.github.io/). 

I've attempted to write in a less technical manner, making it understandable to non-engineers with real examples. Addressing trivial matters like ambiguities, such as whether something should be with or without quotation marks, can create significant challenges. Therefore, I've strived to use real values.
