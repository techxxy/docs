This page explains how to deploy the site you are currently viewing, which is a static Next.js App, to GitHub Pages. If you want to deploy the Next.js Boilerplate (starting page) to GitHub Pages, please refer to [this guide](https://github.com/gregrickaby/nextjs-github-pages/blob/main/README.md).

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

<Steps>
### Configure GitHub Pages Settings
Navigate to Settings > Pages > Build and Deployment > Source, and change `Deploy from a branch` to `GitHub Actions`.

### Edit next.config.js

Replace the content of `next.config.js` with the following code. The added or changed parts are highlighted.

```js {1-3, 5-11, 18-21} copy
/**
 * @type {import('next').NextConfig}
 */

const nextConfig = {
    images: {                   // Using Nextra's image optimization instead of Next's,
        unoptimized: true,      // or an error will occur.
      },
    basePath: '/docs', // Set this with your repository name, or styles will break.
    output: 'export',           // Enabling static export to deploy on GitHub Pages.
  }

const withNextra = require('nextra')({
    theme: 'nextra-theme-docs',
    themeConfig: './theme.config.jsx'
  })

  module.exports = {
    ...withNextra(),
    ...nextConfig,
  };
````

### Run

With basePath now set, when you execute `npm run dev`, the website will be accessible at http://localhost:3000/basePath instead of http://localhost:3000.

### Build

Execute `npm run build` and verify that the `out` folder is generated in the project directory.

### Start

Launch the site by running `npx serve@latest out` and ensure it's accessible at http://localhost:3000/basePath.

### Push to Repository

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "apply static export out"
git push origin main
```

### Verify GitHub Pages

Navigate to `Actions` to review the deployment status. Click on the gear icon within the GitHub repository and choose `Use your GitHub Pages website` to update the link under About.
