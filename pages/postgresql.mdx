# PostgresSQL

## Installation using Homebrew
This section explains how to install PostgresSQL16 on Mac using Homebrew. Check the recent stable version [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/). For detailed explanation, please refer to [this artical](https://medium.com/@abhinavsinha_/download-and-configure-postgresql16-on-macos-d41dc49217b6). Explanation of this artile is great.

My process is slighlty different to find the right path.

```zsh
brew install postgresql@16
brew services start postgresql@16
sudo find / -name pg_config
```
``control + C`` to stop displaying more results

Copy the part of the first result. My first result:
``/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql@16/16.2_1/bin``/pg_config

and paste it at the end of the follwoing 
``export PATH=$PATH:``

so make it, as ``export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql@16/16.2_1/bin``

open .zschrc file
```zsh copy
open ~/.zshrc
```
Past it at the end of the file. 
Save and close it. 
``` zsh filename=".zshrc"
# postgres
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql@16/16.2_1/bin
````


``` zsh
source ~/.zshrc
psql --version
```

## Configuring PostgreSQL

``` zsh
psql -U techxxy postgres
ALTER USER techxxy PASSWORD '<PASSWORD>';
\q
sudo -u techxxy psql postgres -c "SHOW hba_file;"
```



## Changing Vercel psql to locally installed PostgreSQL

Install [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com), a collection of node.js modules for interfacing with your PostgreSQL database.

``` zsh
npm install pg
```
