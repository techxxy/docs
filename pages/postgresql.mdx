[Next.js Dashboard App Example](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app) uses Vercel's Postgres as described in [Next.js Environment](nextjs) page. I changed it to use a local Postgres.

To do this,

1. PostgreSQL should be installed in Local and database and user should be created.
2. Environmental Valiable should be changed.
3. nodemodules for database interaction should be replaced from [@vercel/postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres/sdk) to [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/features/connecting).

The most of the information in Internet was fragmented and not organized. So it was a little tough to finish. So here I stated useful links to follow.

## 1. Configuration

<Steps>
  ### Installation 
  [Abhinav Sinha's post](https://medium.com/@abhinavsinha_/download-and-configure-postgresql16-on-macos-d41dc49217b6) explains really good how to install PostgreSQL v16 on Mac using Homebrew. Please followed the instruction. 
  
  The post ends after  a least previeleged user with password creation. So we will give permission to the user to create Database and create tables.

  ### Database Creation
  In the PostgreSQL database name, ``-`` should not included. lower case or ``_`` are used. My database name is ``nextjs_dashboard``. For naming convetion, check [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2878408).

  ```zsh 
    CREATE DATABASE nextjs_dashboard; 
  ``` 


  ### permission

</Steps>


```zsh CREATE DATABASE database_name;
  CREATE DATABASE nextjs_dashboard; 
``` 



My process is slighlty different to find the right path.

```zsh
brew install postgresql@16
brew services start postgresql@16
sudo find / -name pg_config
```

`control + C` to stop displaying more results

Copy the part of the first result. My first result:
`/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql@16/16.2_1/bin`/pg_config

and paste it at the end of the follwoing
`export PATH=$PATH:`

so make it, as `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql@16/16.2_1/bin`

open .zschrc file

```zsh copy
open ~/.zshrc
```

Past it at the end of the file.
Save and close it.

```zsh filename=".zshrc"
# postgres
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql@16/16.2_1/bin
```

```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
psql --version
```

## Configuring PostgreSQL

```zsh
psql -U techxxy postgres
ALTER USER techxxy PASSWORD '<PASSWORD>';
\q
sudo -u techxxy psql postgres -c "SHOW hba_file;"
```

brew services stop postgresql

## Changing Vercel psql to locally installed PostgreSQL

##

how to delel all the table and data

## How to set evn

```json filename="package.json"
"seed": "node -r dotenv/config ./scripts/seed.js"
```

```json filename="package.json"
"seed": "node -r dotenv/config ./scripts/seed.js dotenv_config_path=.env.local"
```

```json filename = package.json

"dev": "npm run open-browser && next",
"open-browser": "open http://localhost:3000/docs",

```

## Operation DATABASE
```zsh filename=""
```


```zsh filename=""
psql -U <CURRENTLY_LOGGED_IN_MAC_USERNAME> postgres
psql -U jeeyoungpark postgres
```

```zsh filename="assign passwaord to this user"
ALTER USER user_name WITH PASSWORD 'new_password';
ALTER USER jeeyoungpark WITH PASSWORD 'new_password';
```

```zsh filename=""
CREATE USER myuser WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '77hshsh';
```

```zsh filename="To check the status"
launchctl list | grep postgres
```
when it's running, my result is ``693	0	homebrew.mxcl.postgresql@16``

```zsh filename="To start now and relaunch at login"

brew services start postgresql@16
brew services restart postgresql@16
brew services stop postgresql@16
```

## Create DAtabase
```zsh filename=""
CREATE DATABASE sign_up;
```

```zsh filename=""
CREATE DATABASE blog_nextjs_auth;
DROP DATABASE postgres;
```

User Permission
