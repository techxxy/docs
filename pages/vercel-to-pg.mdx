# Vercel/PostgreSQL to Local Migration: Next.js Dashboard App

I have migrated the database of the [Next.js Dashboard App](nextjs) from Vercel/PostgreSQL (referred to as Postgres) to a local setup. You can find the [code differences](https://github.com/techxxy/nextjs-dashboard/compare/v1.0...techxxy:nextjs-dashboard:v.1.1.1) on GitHub. The actual code changes required for the migration are contained within the following four files: 

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="scripts" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="seed.js" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.Folder name="app/lib" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="actions.ts" />
    <FileTree.File name="data.ts" />
    <FileTree.File name="auth.th" />
    <FileTree.File name="db.ts" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## Migration

<Steps>
### Installing PostgreSQL Locally
The process of installing PostgreSQL locally will be explained on a separate page later.

### Updating the .env File
Instructions for updating the .env file will be provided on a separate page later.

### Installing the pg Package in the Project

Install the [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com) package (abbreviated as pg), which is a collection of Node.js modules for interfacing with your PostgreSQL database. For local PostgreSQL, we use the pg package, while for Vercel/Postgres, the @Vercel/Postgres package is utilized.

This installation process will update the ``package-lock.json`` and ``package.jason`` files. Use the following command:

```zsh
npm install pg
```
